/**
 * Standalone runner - boots RuneLite in developer mode with 2h Why Lag injected. This is what
 * {@code gradlew run} starts (see the {@code run} task in build.gradle), and it is the route the Plugin Hub's
 * README and templateplugin/AGENTS.md tell people to test a plugin with.
 *
 * <p>It lives in the TEST source set on purpose: the packaged jar is built from {@code sourceSets.main}
 * only, so this class can never reach a Hub client. It carries no {@code @Test} method - it is a
 * {@code main()}, not a unit test - so the test task simply skips it.
 *
 * <p>Requires assertions: {@code ExternalPluginManager.loadBuiltin} refuses to run without {@code -ea}, which
 * the {@code run} task passes.
